This repository contains the bioinformatic pipeline and scripts used for our study on how sexual selection influences genetic diversity in the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. We conducted experimental evolution in which we manipulated the sexual selection intensity by skewing sex ratio for 28 generations, followed by whole-genome resequencing. Both treatments contained 4 replicates with 1000 individual in each line. The pipeline includes steps for quality control, read trimming and mapping and PoPoolation analysis. We performed GLM to identify SNPs which diverged during experimental evolution between female- and male-biased lines. ACER test was used to find SNPs which responded to selection within each treatment. We also estimated genome-wide diversity measures (π, θ, Tajima's D) to assess changes in genetic variation. The results showed that male-biased lines lost nucleotide diversity at a slower rate compared to female-biased lines, but only at synonymous positions.
